# GatorGuard

## Inspiration

Studies have found that more than half of Gen Z has experienced burnout and/or consistent stress and worry. As college students, we have felt the impact of burnout and stress firsthand. This is why we built GatorGuard, an immersive, AI-powered productivity application that helps users stay focused while also managing their stress and burnout levels.

## What It Does

GatorGuard is a full-stack productivity tool that helps users manage their browser sessions and stay on task. It provides three customizable browsing modes:

- **Study Mode**  
  Focused on academic work, with optional sub-modes:
  - Interview Prep
  - Studying for School

- **Work Mode**  
  Designed for professional productivity and task completion.

- **Leisure Mode**  
  Encourages healthy breaks and relaxation without distractions from work or study content.

The GatorGuard browser extension actively monitors the content of the current tab and determines whether it aligns with the selected mode. If a user strays from their intended focus area, the extension gently notifies them, helping them return to their priorities.
